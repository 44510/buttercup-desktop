## About

Buttercup is a free, open-source and cross-platform **password manager**, built on NodeJS with Typescript. It uses strong industry-standard encryption to protect your passwords and credentials (among other data you store in Buttercup vaults) at rest, within vault files (`.bcup`). Vaults can be loaded from and saved to a number of sources, such as the **local filesystem**, **Dropbox**, **Google Drive** or any **WebDAV**-enabled service (like _ownCloud_ or _Nextcloud_ ยน).

### Why you need a password manager

Password management is a crucial tool when you have _any_ online presence. It's vital that all of your accounts online use strong and unique passwords so that they're much more difficult to break in to. Even if one of your accounts are breached, having unique passwords means that the likelihood of the attacker gaining further access to your accounts portfolio is greatly reduced.

Without a password manager, such as Buttercup, it would be very tedious to manage different passwords for each service. If you remember your passwords it's a good sign that they're not strong enough. Ideally you should memorise a primary password for your vault, and not know any of the account-specific passwords off the top of your head.

## Configuration

Configuration files are stored in OS-specific locations.

### App config

Application configuration.

 * Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Buttercup/desktop.config.json`
 * Mac: `~/Library/Preferences/Buttercup/desktop.config.json`
 * Windows: `$APPDATA/Buttercup/Config/desktop.config.json`

### Vault storage

Storage of connected vaults (not actual vault contents).

 * Linux: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/Buttercup/vaults.json`
 * Mac: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Buttercup/vaults.json`
 * Windows: `$LOCALAPPDATA/Buttercup/Data/vaults.json`

### Offline vault cache

Stored copies of vaults for offline use.

 * Linux: `$(node -e "console.log(os.tmpdir())")/$(whoami)/Buttercup/vaults-offline.cache.json`
 * Mac: `$(node -e "console.log(os.tmpdir())")/Buttercup/vaults-offline.cache.json`
 * Windows: `$(node -e "console.log(os.tmpdir())")/Buttercup/vaults-offline.cache.json`

### Logs

Logs are written for all app sessions.

 * Linux: `~/.local/state/Buttercup-nodejs` or `$XDG_STATE_HOME/Buttercup-nodejs`
 * Mac: `~/Library/Logs/Buttercup-nodejs`
 * Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Buttercup-nodejs\Log`

_Note that logs for portable Windows applications will be written to the same directory that the executable resides in._

## Published Applications

You can view the current releases on the [Buttercup Desktop releases page](https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-desktop/releases). Under each release are some assets - the various binaries and installers for each platform Buttercup supports. When installing or downloading, make sure to pick the right operating system and architecture for your machine.

_Note that at this time, Buttercup only supports x64 (64 bit) machines._

### Linux

We provide an **AppImage** build for Linux, because it is the most desirable format for us to release. AppImages support auto-updating, a crucial feature (we feel) for a security application. The other build types do not.

We won't be supporting formats like Snapcraft, deb or rpm images as they do not align with our requirements. Issues requesting these formats will be closed immediately. Discussion on topics like this should be started on other social channels.

## Notes and Caveats

 * ยน External services like Nextcloud and ownCloud must be configured correctly to support access via the web (using WebDAV). CORS must permit access from any source.
